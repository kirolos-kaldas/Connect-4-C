 * This is the main html documentation of assignment 1 for COSC1076 -
 * Advanced Programming Techniques for semester 2, 2015. You will find
 * here a description of the functions that you need to implement for
 * your assignment.
 *
 * Please note that this should not be your first stop when starting
 * your assignment. Please read the assignment 1 specifications that
 * are available on blackboard before reading this documentation. The
 * purpose of this documentation is to clarify the actual individual
 * requirements.
 *
 * This site presents you with the documentation for each function
 * that you need to implement broken down by the file that they exist
 * in. Please go to the <b>Files</b> tab and click on the file you wish to
 * get more information about and then click on that file. An
 * explanation of each function implemented in that file will be
 * displayed.

 * the entry point into the game. You should display the main menu and

 * The main menu should look like this: 
 * Welcome to connect 4

 * 1. Play Game
 * 2. Display High Scores
 * 3. Quit
 * Please enter your choice:

 * This menu should also be redisplayed when the program returns from
